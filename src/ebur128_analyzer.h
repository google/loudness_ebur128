// EbuR128Analyzer measures loudness statistics according to ITU 1770-4, EBU
// TECH 3341, and EBU TECH 3342. Please refer to those documents for more
// information about loudness measurement standards:
//   https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1770
//   https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/tech3341
//   https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/tech3342
//
// Some terminology:
//
// Momentary Loudness: EBU TECH 3341 defines that loudness measured on a
//    single 400 ms block is a measurement of "momentary loudness", and that
//    it should update at a minimum rate of 10 Hz.
//
// Gating Block: ITU 1770-4 does not explicitly use the term "momentary
//    loudness", but it defines the concept of a "gating block" that is
//    effectively the same; a gating block is a 400 millisecond block. The
//    word "gating" comes from the usage of absolute/relative gating methods
//    which are used to decide whether to use or discard a given momentary
//    loudness.
//
// Absolute Gating: ITU 1770 defines an absolute threshold of -70 LKFS, and
//    any momentary loudness measurement that is less than -70 LKFS will be
//    discarded when computing absolute-gated loudness.
//
// Relative Gating: ITU 1770 also defines a relative threshold of -10 dB,
//    which can only be derived after computing absolute-gated loudness. Any
//    momentary loudness measurement that is less than either the relative or
//    absolute threshold will be discarded when computing relative-gated
//    loudness
//
// Short-term Loudness: refers to ungated loudness measurement performed over
//    3-second blocks. ITU 1770-4 does not specify anything about short-term
//    loudness, this is defined by EBU TECH 3341.
//
// Integrated Loudness: refers to long-running average loudness as specified
//    by ITU 1770-4. In particular, ITU 1770-4 defines integrated loudness as
//    "relative gated integrated loudness".
//
// Loudness Range: EBU TECH 3342 defines loudness range as the interval
//    between 10% - 95% percentile relative-gated short-term loudness
//    measurements. Note carefully: EBU 3341 definition for short-term
//    loudness is defined as ungated, but for EBU 3342 LRA measurements, it is
//    relative-gated. Also note that the relative gate used for LRA
//    measurement uses a different relative threshold (-20 dB) than ITU 1770
//    defines for integrated loudness (-10 dB).
//
// True Peak: In the analog waveform, amplitude peaks might exist between
//    digital samples. ITU 1770 defines how to measure True Peak of a signal
//    by using at least 4x oversampling, with specifically defined upsampling
//    filters.
//
// PLR (Peak to Loudness Ratio): The ratio between a signal's peak amplitude
//     and integrated loudness.
//
// PSR (Peak to Short-term Loudness Ratio): This is a non-standard but useful
//    indicator of how "peaky" an audio signal is compared to its perceived
//    loudness. It is similar to PLR (Peak to Loudness Ratio), but PLR may be
//    less meaningful because it only considers one peak for the entire audio
//    signal. Such a global peak may not be representative of the "peakiness"
//    at any other moment in the audio signal. Instead, PSR only considers the
//    local peak within one short-term block, compared to that block's
//    short-term loudness.
